# Contentful Image Editor App

Contentful provides a basic mechanism for resizing and cropping images, which is sufficient in most cases.
However, if you require additional flexibility, you will need to edit your image outside of Contentful and upload it again.
This app integrates with the Filerobot Image Editor (https://github.com/scaleflex/filerobot-image-editor),
enabling you to edit images directly from the Entry editor.
Ideally the Image Editor should be located inside the Asset editor, but Contentful Apps are not allowed there.

## ðŸ¥· Development

Clone this Repo and install dependencies `pnpm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `pnpm run start`

Creates or updates your app definition in Contentful, and runs the app in development mode.
Open your app to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `pnpm run upload`

Uploads the `dist` folder to Contentful and creates a bundle that is automatically activated.
The command guides you through the deployment process and asks for all required arguments.
Read [here](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/extensibility/app-framework/create-contentful-app/#deploy-with-contentful) for more information about the deployment process.

#### `pnpm run upload-ci`

Similar to `npm run upload` it will upload your app to contentful and activate it. The only difference is
that with this command all required arguments are read from the environment variables, for example when you add
the upload command to your CI pipeline.

For this command to work, the following environment variables must be set:

- `CONTENTFUL_ORG_ID` - The ID of your organization
- `CONTENTFUL_APP_DEF_ID` - The ID of the app to which to add the bundle
- `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - A personal [access token](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/#/reference/personal-access-tokens)
